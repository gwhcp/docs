Python Virtual Environment
==========================

Change to the *gwhcp* system user.

    .. code-block:: none

       python -m venv python3
       source python3/bin/activate
       pip install -r worker/requirements/prod.txt
       deactivate

.. note::

    All projects will use a single Python Virtual Environment.
    This will also help keep all projects updated using the same source modules.
