Contributing to GWHCP
=====================

As an open source project, GWHCP welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

GWHCP uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gwhcp/docs/issues) to keep track of 
bugs, feature requests, and associated patches.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't file a ticket,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution.

Code of Conduct

As a contributor, you can help us keep the GWHCP community open and inclusive.
